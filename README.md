# DETECTING FRAUDULENT CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS WITH MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

The dataset used in this project is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud


This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning algorithms.
A major challenge, however, is that there are not enough fraudulent data samples for machines to create stable patterns from human behavior. As a result, fraudulent transactions tend to be imbalanced and disguised as genuine.


To address this issue, a data-level approach using the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) resampling technique was implemented.


Predictive machine learning models like Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, ANN, and Super Vector Machine Algorithms, were trained and applied to skewed datasets to determine whether credit card transactions were legitimate or fraudulent.
